# Communicate findings from analysing FORD GoBike share data

This project was done as a part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nano Degree .

# Introduction
In this project, I try to understand how usage patterns vary across user types of Subscribers and Customers.
The data consisted of information about bike share trips taken from July 2017 to June 2018. The information contains user type , 
ride duration, ride start and end station details etc. Approximately 5% data points were removed from the analysis due to inconsistencies or missing information.

# Tools Used
- Jypyter Notebooks - Environment used for the project
- Python - Programming language in which the analysis was done
- Python libraries :
  - Pandas and Numpy for Data Wrangling
  - Matplotlib and seaborn for Data Visualization
- Data was gathered from a csv file

# Summary of Findings
 - The Subscribers use the bike service to commute to work and majority of their rides lasted less than 30 min.
 - Customers use the Bike Service for leisure and they prefer to take the bikes out on long rides.
 - The Subscribers who generally ride for a shorter duration have a long ride limit of 45 min and the Customers who prefer to go on long rides are given a shorter ride limit of 30 min.
 - The Customers are not likely to find the ride limit and pricing to be convenient. A Separate long ride plan for Customerss would make a better bike sharing experience for them.
